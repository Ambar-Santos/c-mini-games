//Intructions from excalibur

/*
Lord Death is concerned about the madness of wavelengths in Death City. 
Write a program that does the following:
Asks the user to input their current sanity level (a number between 0 and 100).

Based on the input, prints a diagnosis:

    If sanity is 80 or higher: "Your soul is sound! A model for DWMA!"

    If sanity is between 50 and 79: "You show signs of strain. Meditate with your weapon."

    If sanity is between 25 and 49: "Madness is approaching! Report to Lord Death immediately!"

    If sanity is below 25: "KISHIN ALERT! CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS ACTIVATED!"
